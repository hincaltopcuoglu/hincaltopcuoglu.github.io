<p><img src="symbolic_derivative_tool_banner_resized.png" alt="Symbolic Derivative Tool Graphic" /></p>

<h2>🔄 Introduction</h2>

<p>In both machine learning and scientific computing, derivatives are at the core of optimization, analysis, and inference. While numerical differentiation is common, it can be unstable or inaccurate when dealing with complex functions or symbolic models.</p>

<p>To address this, we've developed the <strong>Symbolic Derivative Tool</strong>, a Python-based utility leveraging Python's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to provide symbolic derivatives, gradients, Jacobians, and Hessians — all without relying on external libraries like SymPy. This tool bridges the gap between symbolic mathematics and practical data science workflows.</p>

<h2>🔍 Mathematical Foundations</h2>

<p>Understanding the fundamental mathematical operations supported by this tool helps reveal its power and relevance:</p>

<h3>∑ Limit Theorem</h3>

<p>The tool symbolically computes limit expressions, helping users explore function behavior near discontinuities or singularities. This is crucial in mathematical analysis and neural network activation boundary checks.</p>

<h3>∂ Derivatives</h3>

<p>The core operation, derivative computation, is essential in optimization algorithms, from simple linear regression to complex gradient descent in deep learning.</p>

<h3>∇ Gradients</h3>

<p>A gradient is a vector of partial derivatives. In machine learning, gradients drive learning via backpropagation to adjust weights in neural networks.</p>

<h3>∂² Hessian Matrix</h3>

<p>The Hessian is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives. It describes local curvature and is crucial in second-order optimization algorithms like Newton’s Method.</p>

<h3>∂ Jacobian Matrix</h3>

<p>The Jacobian matrix represents partial derivatives of vector-valued functions and is critical in transformations, inverse functions, and deep learning architectures like attention mechanisms and GANs.</p>

<h3>Σ Taylor Series Expansion</h3>

<p>Taylor series approximates complex functions using derivatives at a point. In ML, it's used in model interpretability, error estimation, and theoretical analysis.</p>

<h3>○ Laplacian Operator</h3>

<p>The Laplacian sums second-order partial derivatives. It appears in physics (e.g., heat/diffusion equations), and graph-based ML for smoothness/regularization.</p>

<h3>→ Directional Derivatives</h3>

<p>This measures how a function changes in any direction, used in constrained optimization, reinforcement learning, and optimization landscapes.</p>

<h2>🔧 Getting Started</h2>

<h1>Clone the repository</h1>

<p> git clone https://github.com/hincaltopcuoglu/Symbolic-Derivative-Tool.git
cd Symbolic-Derivative-Tool</p>

<h1>Install dependencies</h1>

<p> pip install -r requirements.txt</p>

<h1>Run the tool</h1>

<p> python derivative_tool.py
</p>

<h2>📄 Example Interaction Flow</h2>

<p>When you run the tool via:</p>

<p><code>
python derivative_tool.py
</code></p>

<p>you'll be prompted step-by-step to symbolically analyze your function. Here's a sample interaction:</p>

<p>
Enter a function (e.g. f(x, y) = x<strong>2 + y</strong>2): f(x, y) = x<strong>2 + 3<em>x</em>y + y</strong>2
Differentiate with respect to: x
Enter values for variables (e.g. x=1, y=2): x=1, y=2</p>

<p>🧪 Select an operation to perform:
1. Compare Derivative Approximations (Limit-based)
2. Compute Gradient
3. Compare Gradient with Numerical Derivatives
4. Compute Hessian Matrix
5. Compute Laplacian
6. Taylor Series
7. Compute Directional Derivative
8. Symbolic Chain Rule Expansion
9. Exit
</p>

<p>
from symbolic_diff import SymbolicDifferentiator</p>

<p>expr = "x<strong>2 + 3<em>x</em>y + y</strong>2"
sd = SymbolicDifferentiator(expr, variables=["x", "y"])</p>

<p>print("Gradient:", sd.evaluate<em>gradient(x=1, y=2))
print("Hessian:", sd.evaluate</em>hessian(x=1, y=2))
</p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<p><code>
Gradient: {'x': 9.0, 'y': 8.0}
Hessian: [[2.0, 3.0], [3.0, 2.0]]
